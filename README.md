## TODO

1. Android video Aspect ratio and other params does not work(Events are called but all events come through a single event onVideoStateChange but the JS side does not implement it.).

## Got a few minutes to spare? Please help us to keep this repo up to date and simple to use. 

#### Our idea was to keep the repo simple, and people can use it with newer RN versions without any additional config.


1. Get a fork of tis repo and clone [VLC Media Player test](https://github.com/vinhnq90/react-native-vlc-media-player-wesmart-test) 
2. Run it for ios and android locally using your fork, and do the changes. (remove this package using ```npm remove react-native-vlc-media-player-wesmart``` and install the forked version from git hub ```npm i https://git-address-to-your-forked-repo```)  
3. Verify your changes and make sure everything works on both platforms. (If you need a hand with testing I might be able to help as well)
4. Send PR.
5. Be happy, Coz you are a Rockstart üåü ‚ù§Ô∏è
